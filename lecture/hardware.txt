Hardware Considerations

RAID Systems
1. RAID 0
    - Disk Striping
        - When we write one activity across many disks, which is writing in parallel
        - Kind of like buying one box of large pizza instead of a bunch of smaller
    - Great performance
    - Lousy fault tolerance
    - Great disk cost- efficiency

2. RAID 1
    - Good performance
    - Better fault tolerance
    - Fair disk cost-efficiency (N / 2)

3. RAID 5
    - Striping + parity
    - Fair performance
    - Fair fault tolerance
    - Good disk cost efficiency
    - ** We do not really like this **

4. RAID 1 + 0
    - Mirroring + Striping
    - Good performance & fault tolerance
    - Okay disc cost efficiency

Maintenance

- Once we define the threats to an environment, we can define "daily tasks" that alleviate or mitigate the risks that will affect our system adversely
    - Daily backups
    - Checking error logs
    - Wiring shift hand-off report


GOAL:
    - Build a routine set of tasks that improve the value of the database environment
    - Covers all the components
        - Hardware
        - Processes
        - People
    - Must address the *defined vulnerabilities* with tasks that *proactively reduce* the opportunity for failures to occur
    - *All maintenance is defined, scheduled and practiced*
